# PseudoInsta

### PseudoInsta is a simple application that allows sharing pictures with authenticated guests, without a database.

If you want to try it out, the current password for logging in is "pseudo_insta". The application provides a load more button, showing 8 pictures at a time, so you can add more pictures in the resources/imgz folder.

Feel free to delete the picture of me holding a handstand.
