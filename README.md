# Pseudo Insta

### Pseudo Insta is a simple application that allows sharing pictures with authenticated guests, without a database.

If you want to try it out, the current password for logging in is "pseudo_insta". 

You can add images ~~in the resources/imgz folder manualy, but I recommend~~ using the "admin panel". It generates standard names and thumbnails for each uploaded image.

Feel free to delete the picture of me holding a handstand.
